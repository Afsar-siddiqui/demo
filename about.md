Project Overview
This project is a simple Angular application that demonstrates basic functionality. While it currently does not include a layout structure, there is potential to enhance it by implementing a reusable layout with a shared header and footer. This would allow for consistent navigation and design across all components, with only the main content area changing dynamically based on the selected component.
